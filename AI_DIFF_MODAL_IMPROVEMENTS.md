# AI Diff Modal Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. **Solid Borders Instead of Dashed** âœ…
- Changed from `border: 2px dashed` to `border: 2px solid` in DiffMark.js
- Suggestions now have solid borders as requested
- Still clearly shows these are suggestions with background colors and tooltips

### 2. **Auto-Close Modal After Processing** âœ…
- Modal no longer closes immediately when clicking "Get AI Suggestions"
- Instead, it stays open showing loading state while AI processes
- Once suggestions are applied, modal automatically closes
- This provides better user experience - you see the modal close = work is done

## How It Works Now

1. **Select text â†’ Press Cmd+K** - Modal opens
2. **Enter instruction â†’ Submit** - Modal shows loading spinner
3. **AI processes in background** - Modal stays open
4. **Suggestions applied to editor** - Modal automatically closes
5. **Notification appears** - Explains how to review changes
6. **Click suggestions** - Accept/reject each one

## Technical Changes

### AIEditModal.jsx
- Removed automatic `onClose()` after submission
- Parent component now controls when to close
- Loading state persists until parent closes modal

### DocumentEditorPage.jsx
- Added `setShowAIEditModal(false)` after successful processing
- Also closes modal on error or when no changes suggested
- Ensures modal closes at the right time

### editProcessor.js
- Added 100ms delay to notification to ensure it appears after modal closes
- Increased z-index to 100000 to ensure visibility
- Notification clearly explains next steps

## Testing

Run the test script to verify behavior:
```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = '/test-ai-edit-modal-close.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

This monitors:
- Modal open/close states
- Notification appearance
- Proper timing of events

"The path to good UX is closing things at the right time, not too early, not too late." ðŸŒŸ
