# Cmd+K Duplicate Handler Fix

## The Problem

When pressing Cmd+K to trigger AI edit suggestions, the system was firing duplicate handlers:

1. **Main handler** in `DocumentEditorPage.jsx` (line 333-351)
2. **Extension handler** in `DiffExtensionV2.js` (line 673-688)

This caused:
- Confusing behavior where processing seemed to start immediately
- Potential double modal triggers
- Race conditions between handlers

## Root Cause

The DiffExtension was configured with `enableKeyboardShortcuts: true`, which registered its own Cmd+K handler. Both handlers would fire simultaneously when the user pressed Cmd+K.

## The Solution

### 1. Disabled Duplicate Handler
Commented out the Cmd+K handler in `DiffExtensionV2.js`:

```javascript
// DISABLED: Cmd+K is now handled in DocumentEditorPage to avoid conflicts
// Request AI edit
/*
'Mod-k': () => {
  const { selection } = this.editor.state
  if (!selection.empty && this.options.onRequestEdit) {
    const text = this.editor.state.doc.textBetween(selection.from, selection.to)
    this.options.onRequestEdit({
      selection: {
        from: selection.from,
        to: selection.to,
        text
      }
    })
  }
  return true
}
*/
```

### 2. Single Handler Flow
Now only the main handler in DocumentEditorPage manages Cmd+K:
- Checks for selected text
- Shows the AI Edit modal
- No duplicate processing

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:

```javascript
await import('./public/test-cmd-k-fix.js')
```

This will:
1. Check if DiffExtension's Cmd+K is disabled
2. Monitor keyboard events for duplicates
3. Verify only one modal appears

## Result

- Clean, single-trigger behavior for Cmd+K
- No more "already processing" confusion
- Predictable modal behavior
- Better user experience
