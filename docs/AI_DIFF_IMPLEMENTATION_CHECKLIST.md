# AI Diff System Implementation Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Implementation Verification - CRITICAL UPDATE!
**THE DIFF SYSTEM IS 100% COMPLETE AND WORKING!**
- [x] Diff visualization works (DiffExtensionV2, DiffMark, DiffOverlay)
- [x] Position tracking works perfectly
- [x] ChangeManagerV2 exists and functions
- [x] Test Diff button creates modifications with "TEST"
- [x] Accept/reject UI works perfectly

## What Actually Needs to be Done

### Phase 1: Mock AI Integration (Day 1)
- [ ] Create `src/services/mockAIService.js`
  - [ ] Implement `generateEdits()` that returns AI-style responses
  - [ ] Return JSON format per AI_DIFF_LLM_RESPONSE_FORMAT.md
  - [ ] Test with variety of edit types
  
- [ ] Create `src/utils/editProcessor.js`
  - [ ] Implement `findAllOccurrences()` function
  - [ ] Parse AI responses
  - [ ] Convert 1-based to 0-based indexing

**üß™ TESTING CHECKPOINT 1:**
```javascript
// Test that your mock service returns proper format:
const response = await mockAIService.generateEdits("old text", "make formal")
console.log(response) // Should have edits array

// Test with existing diff system:
editor.commands.addChange({
  type: 'modification',
  originalText: 'test',
  suggestedText: response.edits[0].replacement,
  position: { from: 10, to: 14 }
})
```

### Phase 2: Update the Test Diff Button (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Replace hardcoded "TEST" with AI suggestions
- [ ] Add instruction input (modal or prompt)
- [ ] Process multiple edits from AI response
- [ ] Handle different edit types

**üß™ TESTING CHECKPOINT 2:**
```javascript
// The existing button at line 762 in DocumentEditorPage.jsx
// Should now call AI service instead of using "TEST"
```

### Phase 3: Real AI Integration (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Replace mock service with real API call
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Rate limiting

**üß™ TESTING CHECKPOINT 3:**
```javascript
// Test with real AI service
// Verify responses are parsed correctly
// Check that diff marks appear for all edits
```

## ‚ùå DO NOT IMPLEMENT (Already Works!)
- ~~Create ChangeManagerV2~~ ‚úÖ Already exists
- ~~Build diff visualization~~ ‚úÖ Already works
- ~~Create overlay UI~~ ‚úÖ Already works
- ~~Implement position tracking~~ ‚úÖ Already works
- ~~Add accept/reject functionality~~ ‚úÖ Already works

## Success Criteria
- [ ] ‚úÖ Clicking Test Diff button shows AI suggestions (not "TEST")
- [ ] ‚úÖ Multiple edits from AI are processed
- [ ] ‚úÖ Position accuracy maintained
- [ ] ‚úÖ Different edit types work (modification, deletion, addition)

## Quick Test
```javascript
// This already works! Try it:
editor.commands.addChange({
  type: 'modification',
  originalText: 'hello',
  suggestedText: 'greetings',
  position: { from: 0, to: 5 }
})
// You'll see a diff mark appear!
```

## Notes
- The diff system is COMPLETE - just feed it data
- Focus only on AI integration
- Test with the existing working system
- Don't reimplement anything!
