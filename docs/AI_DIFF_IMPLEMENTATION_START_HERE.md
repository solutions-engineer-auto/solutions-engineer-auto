# 🚀 AI Diff Implementation - START HERE

## 🎉 GREAT NEWS: The Diff System Already Works!

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Select text
- ✅ Click "Test Diff" button
- ✅ See diff mark with "TEST" as replacement
- ✅ Click mark to see overlay
- ✅ Accept/reject works perfectly

**Your ONLY job:** Replace "TEST" with AI-generated suggestions!

## 📄 The Updated Ultimate Prompt
**AI_DIFF_ULTIMATE_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md**

This prompt has been updated to reflect that:
- The diff system is 100% complete
- You only need to add AI integration
- Don't reimplement anything that already works

## 🎯 Simplified Implementation Plan

### What You Need to Do:
1. **Create mockAIService.js** - Returns AI suggestions instead of "TEST"
2. **Create editProcessor.js** - Parses AI responses
3. **Update the button** - Call AI service instead of hardcoding "TEST"

### What You DON'T Need to Do:
- ❌ Build diff visualization (already works!)
- ❌ Create overlay UI (already works!)
- ❌ Implement position tracking (already works!)
- ❌ Create ChangeManagerV2 (already exists!)

## ⚡ Quick Test

Try this in the browser console to see the diff system working:
```javascript
editor.commands.addChange({
  type: 'modification',
  originalText: 'hello',
  suggestedText: 'greetings',
  position: { from: 0, to: 5 }
})
```

## 📋 Actual Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Mock AI Integration (2-3 hours)
- Create mock service
- Update button to use it
- Test with existing diff system

**Day 2**: Real AI Integration (3-4 hours)
- Connect to real API
- Add error handling
- Polish UI

That's it! 2 days instead of 7!

## 🔍 Key Code Location

The button that needs updating is at:
**DocumentEditorPage.jsx line 762**

Currently it does:
```javascript
suggestedText: 'TEST'
```

Change it to:
```javascript
suggestedText: aiResponse.edits[0].replacement
```

## 🚨 Remember

**THE DIFF SYSTEM WORKS PERFECTLY!**
- Don't touch DiffExtensionV2.js
- Don't touch DiffMark.js  
- Don't touch DiffOverlay.jsx
- Don't touch ChangeManagerV2.js

Just feed it AI data!

**Ready? Let's go! 🚀**
