# AI Diff System - Ready to Build! üöÄ

## Project Summary
You're building an AI-powered document editing system where users can:
1. Select text and give high-level instructions ("make this more formal")
2. See visual diff marks showing AI suggestions
3. Accept or reject each change individually

**Great News:** Your diff visualization system already works perfectly! The focus is now on AI integration.

## Timeline: 1 Week (Simplified from 3 weeks)
- **Days 1-2**: Mock AI integration & testing
- **Days 3-5**: Real agent integration
- **Days 6-7**: Position accuracy & polish

## Key Resources Created

### üìã Implementation Checklist
**AI_DIFF_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Your main guide with:
- Pre-implementation verification steps
- Day-by-day tasks with checkboxes
- Testing checkpoints after each phase
- Success criteria

### üìö Technical Documentation
1. **AI_DIFF_LLM_RESPONSE_FORMAT.md** - JSON format the AI should return
2. **AI_DIFF_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md** - How to modify your agent
3. **AI_DIFF_TECHNICAL_CHALLENGES.md** - Position accuracy solutions
4. **AI_DIFF_COMPLETE_GUIDE_SUMMARY.md** - Architecture overview

### üß™ Existing Test Infrastructure
- `/test-position-tracking-fix.js` - Proves position tracking works
- `src/extensions/DiffExtension/README.md` - Complete usage guide
- Test helpers already available in browser console

## Critical Implementation Notes

### ‚úÖ What Already Works
- Diff marks with colors (green=add, red=delete, cyan=modify)
- Click-to-show overlay with accept/reject buttons
- Position tracking with `findMarkPositionById()`
- ChangeManagerV2 for state management
- Undo/redo support

### üéØ What You're Building
- Mock AI service for testing
- Agent endpoint for edit suggestions
- JSON parser for LLM responses
- UI button to trigger AI edits
- Position validation before marking

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Technical Decisions
1. **Use marks, not decorations** - Already implemented correctly
2. **1-based indexing from AI** - More human-friendly
3. **Always validate text matches** - Prevents wrong deletions
4. **Group related changes** - Single edit ID for multiple occurrences

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Pre-Implementation Verification**
   - Run the test script to confirm everything works
   - Review the existing diff system code

2. **Follow the Checklist**
   - Work through Phase 1 (Mock AI)
   - Test thoroughly at each checkpoint
   - Only proceed when confident

3. **Focus on Position Accuracy**
   - This is your main concern
   - The system already handles it well
   - Just validate text before marking

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Test existing diff system
# In browser console on document editor page:
const script = document.createElement('script')
script.src = '/test-position-tracking-fix.js'
document.head.appendChild(script)

# Run local agent (Phase 2)
cd agent && ./run_local.sh

# Check diff mode
editor.commands.toggleDiffMode()

# View current changes
editor.storage.diffV2.changeManager.getChanges()
```

## Remember
- The hard part (diff visualization) is already done ‚úÖ
- You're just connecting AI to existing, working commands
- Test early and often
- Stop immediately if positions seem wrong

Good luck! The foundation is solid, and the path is clear. üéâ
