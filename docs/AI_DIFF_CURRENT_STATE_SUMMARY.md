# AI Diff System - Current State Summary

## üéØ CRITICAL: The Diff System is 100% Working!

### Live Demo Steps:
1. Open document editor
2. Select any text
3. Click "üß™ Test Diff" button
4. See cyan highlight appear
5. Click the highlight
6. See overlay with "TEST" as replacement
7. Click Confirm ‚Üí text changes!
8. Click Decline ‚Üí highlight disappears!

### What Exists (DO NOT REBUILD):
| Component | Status | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| DiffExtensionV2 | ‚úÖ Working | src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffExtensionV2.js | Main extension logic |
| DiffMark | ‚úÖ Working | src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffMark.js | Visual highlights |
| DiffOverlay | ‚úÖ Working | src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffOverlay.jsx | Accept/reject UI |
| ChangeManagerV2 | ‚úÖ Working | src/services/ChangeManagerV2.js | State management |
| Test Diff Button | ‚úÖ Working | Line 762 DocumentEditorPage.jsx | Creates test diffs |

### The Only Code That Needs Changing:
```javascript
// Line 762 in DocumentEditorPage.jsx
const change = {
  type: 'modification',
  originalText: selectedText,
  suggestedText: 'TEST', // ‚Üê ONLY THIS LINE NEEDS TO CHANGE!
  position: { from: selection.from, to: selection.to }
};
```

## üìã Implementation Tasks (2 Days Total)

### Day 1: Mock AI Service (2-3 hours)
1. Create `src/services/mockAIService.js`
   - Function: `generateEdits(text, instruction)`
   - Returns: AI response format JSON
   
2. Update button onClick to:
   ```javascript
   const response = await mockAIService.generateEdits(selectedText, "make formal");
   suggestedText: response.edits[0].replacement
   ```

### Day 2: Real Integration (3-4 hours)
1. Create `src/utils/editProcessor.js`
   - Handle multiple edits
   - Find text positions
   
2. Connect to real AI API
3. Add error handling

## ‚ùå What NOT to Do

**DO NOT:**
- Modify any files in src/extensions/DiffExtension/
- Create new overlay components
- Implement position tracking (already perfect)
- Build a new diff system
- Touch ChangeManagerV2.js

**The diff system is a working Ferrari. Don't rebuild the engine, just change the fuel!**

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You know you're done when:
1. Clicking Test Diff shows AI suggestions (not "TEST")
2. Multiple edits can be processed
3. Error handling works
4. That's it!

## üöÄ Quick Verification

Run this NOW to see it work:
```javascript
editor.commands.addChange({
  type: 'modification',
  originalText: 'the',
  suggestedText: 'THE SYSTEM WORKS!',
  position: { from: 10, to: 13 }
});
```
