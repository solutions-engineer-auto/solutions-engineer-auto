### Cloud Platform Deployments

#### Kubernetes

**Deployment Architecture**:
```yaml
# Example K8s deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: langgraph-agent
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: agent
        image: myregistry/langgraph-fastapi:latest
        env:
        - name: POSTGRES_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-secret
              key: url
```

**Requirements**:
- Wrap LangGraph with FastAPI
- External state storage (PostgreSQL/Redis)
- Ingress controller for routing

**Best For**: Organizations with existing K8s infrastructure

#### AWS Options

**EC2 + Docker**:
- Full control over compute
- Can use spot instances for cost savings
- Requires more management

**ECS** (Coming Soon):
- Container orchestration
- Integrated with AWS services
- Simpler than K8s

**Lambda**:
- Good for simple agents
- Limited by 15-minute timeout
- Cold start considerations

#### BentoML

**Specialized Features**:
- Optimized for ML/LLM workloads
- Built-in model serving
- BentoCloud for managed deployment
- Supports background tasks

**Deployment**:
```python
# bentofile.yaml
service: "service:LangGraphService"
include:
  - "*.py"
python:
  packages:
    - langgraph
    - langchain
```

## DIY FastAPI Deployment Pattern

Most third-party deployments follow this pattern:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langgraph import StateGraph
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize your graph
graph = create_agent_graph()

@app.post("/invoke")
async def invoke_agent(request: AgentRequest):
    result = await graph.ainvoke(request.dict())
    return result

@app.get("/health")
async def health():
    return {"status": "healthy"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```
