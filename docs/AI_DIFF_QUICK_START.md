# AI Diff System - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Select Text
Select any text in the document editor that you want to modify.

### 2. Trigger AI Edit
**Option A:** Click the "🧪 AI Edit" button in the toolbar  
**Option B:** Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux)

### 3. Enter Instruction
Type a clear instruction for how you want the text changed.

### 4. Review & Apply
- **Cyan highlights** = suggested modifications
- Click on any highlight to see the change
- Click **Confirm** to accept or **Decline** to reject

## 💡 Best Practices

### Good Instructions
✅ "Make it more formal"  
✅ "Fix grammar and spelling"  
✅ "Simplify this technical jargon"  
✅ "Add more detail about the benefits"  
✅ "Shorten to one sentence"  

### Less Effective Instructions
❌ "Make it better" (too vague)  
❌ "Change everything" (too broad)  
❌ "Fix" (unclear what to fix)  

## 🎨 Visual Guide

- **Cyan highlight** = Modification suggested
- **Green highlight** = Addition suggested (future)
- **Red highlight** = Deletion suggested

## ⚡ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Mac | Windows/Linux |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| AI Edit | `Cmd+K` | `Ctrl+K` |
| Save | `Cmd+S` | `Ctrl+S` |
| Toggle Diff Mode | `Cmd+D` | `Ctrl+D` |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### No suggestions appearing?
- Try being more specific with your instruction
- Make sure you've selected text first
- Check that the text is editable (not in a finalized document)

### AI not responding?
- Check your internet connection
- Verify OpenAI API key is configured
- Try selecting a smaller piece of text

### Empty results?
Sometimes the AI determines no changes are needed. Try:
- A different instruction
- Selecting different text
- Being more specific about what you want changed

## 📊 Understanding Confidence

Each suggestion includes a confidence score:
- **90-100%**: Very confident in the suggestion
- **70-89%**: Reasonably confident
- **Below 70%**: Less certain, review carefully

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Start small**: Select a sentence or paragraph, not entire sections
2. **Be specific**: "Make more professional" > "Improve"
3. **Chain edits**: Apply one change, then select again for further edits
4. **Use examples**: "Make it sound like a technical manual"
5. **Review carefully**: AI suggestions are just that - suggestions!
