# AI Diff Scaling Solution

## Problem Summary

The Cmd+K AI edit diff feature was failing silently or returning empty responses when processing larger text selections. The issue was NOT with the core functionality, but with how the service handled scaling.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **No Request Timeout**: Fetch API has no default timeout, causing requests to hang indefinitely
2. **Insufficient Output Tokens**: Hard cap of 4000 tokens, but gpt-4o-mini supports up to 16K
3. **No Size Validation**: Large texts were sent to API without checking limits first
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Timeout and size errors weren't handled gracefully

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Request Timeout (30 seconds)
```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 30000);

const response = await fetch(OPENAI_API_URL, {
  // ... other options
  signal: controller.signal
});
```

### 2. Dynamic Token Calculation
- Respects gpt-4o-mini's 128K context window
- Allows up to 16K output tokens (model maximum)
- Scales output based on input size:
  - Small inputs (<5K tokens): Up to full output capacity
  - Medium inputs (5-10K tokens): Capped at 4K output
  - Large inputs (>10K tokens): Capped at 8K output

### 3. Upfront Size Validation
- Maximum input: 30K tokens (~120K characters)
- Clear error message before API call
- Prevents wasted API calls and timeouts

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Specific handling for timeout errors
- Context length exceeded detection
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallbacks

## Token Limits

| Model | Context Window | Max Output | Our Input Limit |
|-------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| gpt-4o-mini | 128K tokens | 16K tokens | 30K tokens |

## Testing

Run the test scripts in browser console:

1. **Basic scaling test**: `public/test-ai-edit-scaling.js`
2. **Fixed implementation test**: `public/test-ai-edit-scaling-fixed.js`

## Usage Guidelines

### ✅ Works Well
- Text selections up to ~120K characters
- Most editing tasks complete in 5-15 seconds
- Multiple edits in the same document

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Very large selections (>120K chars) are rejected
- Complex edits on large text may timeout
- Network speed affects performance

### 💡 Best Practices
1. Select specific paragraphs rather than entire documents
2. Use clear, specific instructions
3. For very large documents, edit in sections
4. Monitor browser console for detailed error messages

## Future Improvements

1. **Streaming Responses**: Use streaming API for real-time feedback
2. **Chunking Strategy**: Automatically split very large texts
3. **Progress Indicators**: Show processing status for long operations
4. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with backoff for transient failures

## Implementation Details

The solution maintains backward compatibility while adding robustness:
- No changes to UI/UX
- Same API interface
- Enhanced under-the-hood handling
- Better error messages for users
