# AI Diff Preview Fix

## Problem Summary

The AI diff system was confusing users because:
1. **Changes appeared to be automatically applied** when they were just preview suggestions
2. **Visual styling made it look like text was already edited** (strikethrough for deletions, etc.)
3. **No clear indication that changes needed to be accepted/rejected**
4. **JSON parsing errors** when AI responses were malformed

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Visual Confusion - Changes Look Already Applied

**Problem**: Diff marks used solid borders and strikethrough text, making it appear changes were already made.

**Solution**: Updated `DiffMark.js` to use:
- **Dashed borders** instead of solid to indicate suggestions
- **Removed strikethrough** for deletions - just highlights what would be deleted
- **Added tooltips** saying "Suggested [type] - Click to accept/reject"
- **Softer background colors** to show these are previews

### 2. Missing User Feedback

**Problem**: Users didn't know they needed to click on changes to accept/reject them.

**Solution**: Added notification system in `editProcessor.js`:
- Shows a notification when suggestions are added
- Clear message: "X suggestions added - Click on highlighted text to accept or reject changes"
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds

### 3. JSON Parsing Errors

**Problem**: AI responses sometimes contained malformed JSON causing silent failures.

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling in `directAIEditService.js`:
- Better logging of parse errors
- Shows exact position where JSON parsing failed
- Provides helpful error messages to users
- Prevents crashes from malformed responses

## How It Works Now

1. **User selects text and presses Cmd+K**
2. **AI generates suggestions** (not direct edits)
3. **Suggestions appear with dashed borders** - clearly previews
4. **Notification appears** explaining how to accept/reject
5. **User clicks on each suggestion** to see accept/reject buttons
6. **Only when "Confirm" is clicked** does the text actually change

## Visual Differences

### Before (Confusing)
- Solid underlines/borders
- Strikethrough text for deletions
- No explanation of what to do
- Looked like changes were already made

### After (Clear)
- Dashed borders showing suggestions
- Highlighted areas without strikethrough
- Clear notification about reviewing changes
- Obvious that these are previews

## Testing

Run the updated test script to verify the fix:
```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = '/test-ai-edit-user-flow.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

This will show:
1. Suggestions appear as previews
2. Notification explains the workflow
3. Clicking suggestions shows accept/reject options
4. Only accepting actually modifies the text
