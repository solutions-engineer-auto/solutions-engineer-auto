# Knowledge Graph RAG Connection Fix Summary

## The Problem

You had:
- 193 embeddings in the database
- 34 documents total
- But only 4 documents had embeddings
- 0 relationships being found

## Root Causes

1. **Join Query Issue**: The inner join between `document_embeddings` and `account_data_sources` was only returning 4 results even though you had many more embeddings.

2. **High Similarity Threshold**: The default threshold of 0.7 (70%) was too high - most document similarities fall between 0.3-0.6.

3. **Missing Document Links**: Many embeddings were orphaned - their `account_data_source_id` didn't match any existing documents.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Lowered Default Threshold**: Changed from 0.7 to 0.5 in `vectorRAGService.js`

2. **Added Dynamic Threshold Control**: 
   - Added a slider in the Graph Controls
   - Can now adjust threshold in real-time
   - See relationships appear/disappear as you adjust

3. **Enhanced Debug Logging**:
   - Shows how many documents have embeddings
   - Shows similarity score distribution
   - Shows how many relationships pass the threshold

4. **Created Debug Scripts**:
   - `test-vector-db.js` - Shows database status
   - `test-rag-debug.js` - Deep dive into relationship generation

## How to Use

1. **Run Debug Script** (in browser console):
   ```javascript
   await debugRAG()
   ```
   This will show you:
   - Why the join might be failing
   - Similarity score distribution
   - What threshold would work best

2. **Adjust Threshold in UI**:
   - Look for the slider in Graph Controls when in RAG mode
   - Start at 0.3 and increase until you get meaningful connections
   - Sweet spot is usually 0.4-0.6

3. **Check Your Embeddings**:
   - Make sure documents have corresponding entries in `account_data_sources`
   - Orphaned embeddings won't create relationships

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Orphaned Embeddings**: 
   - Check why only 4 documents have embeddings when you have 34 documents
   - Ensure the edge function is processing all uploads

2. **Tune the Threshold**:
   - Use the slider to find the optimal threshold for your data
   - Save the preferred threshold in user preferences

3. **Consider Embedding Quality**:
   - If similarities are too low, documents might be too different
   - Or the embedding model might need better prompts

## Quick Test

To see relationships immediately:
1. Toggle to "Using Real RAG" mode
2. Move the similarity threshold slider to 0.3
3. You should see connections appear
4. Adjust to taste - higher = fewer but stronger connections
