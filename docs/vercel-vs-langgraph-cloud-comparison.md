## Cost Analysis

### Vercel Fluid Compute
- Active CPU pricing: Pay only for actual compute time
- Additional costs for:
  - External state storage (Redis/PostgreSQL)
  - Job queue service
  - Review portal hosting
- Estimated monthly cost for 1000 documents: $200-400 + infrastructure

### LangGraph Cloud
- Usage-based pricing with state persistence included
- No additional infrastructure needed
- Estimated monthly cost for 1000 documents: $300-500 all-inclusive

## Implementation Complexity Comparison

### Time to MVP
- **Vercel**: 6-8 weeks (including all workarounds)
- **LangGraph Cloud**: 2-3 weeks

### Required Components

#### Vercel Implementation
1. State persistence service
2. Job queue for long-running tasks
3. Webhook service for human reviews
4. Custom review portal
5. Session management system
6. Monitoring dashboard
7. Error recovery mechanisms

#### LangGraph Cloud Implementation
1. LangGraph agent definition
2. Basic UI for human reviews (optional - Studio provides default)

## Specific Recommendations for Our Use Case

### Why LangGraph Cloud is Superior for Sales Document Generation

1. **Complex State Requirements**
   - Our agent needs to track multiple document versions, customer context, and generation progress
   - LangGraph's native state management eliminates significant engineering overhead

2. **Human Review Cycles**
   - Sales documents require multiple approval stages (technical, commercial, legal)
   - Indefinite pause capability is critical for asynchronous reviews
   - Vercel's 14-minute limit is incompatible with real-world review timelines

3. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - Different specialized agents for technical writing, competitive analysis, and pricing
   - LangGraph provides native orchestration; Vercel requires complex coordination logic

4. **Debugging & Iteration**
   - Sales engineers need visibility into document generation logic
   - LangGraph Studio provides visual debugging essential for non-technical users

### Migration Path Recommendation

1. **Short Term**: Prototype on LangGraph Cloud to validate agent architecture
2. **Medium Term**: Leverage LangGraph's built-in features for rapid iteration
3. **Long Term**: Evaluate self-hosting LangGraph if cost becomes a concern

### When Vercel Might Make Sense

Vercel could be viable only if:
- Document generation is simple and completes in <14 minutes
- No human review is required
- State persistence is minimal
- You have engineering resources for building infrastructure

## Conclusion

For our sales document generation use case, LangGraph Cloud provides essential features that would require months of engineering effort to replicate on Vercel. The native support for state persistence, human-in-the-loop workflows, and indefinite execution pauses makes LangGraph Cloud the clear choice for building a production-ready sales engineering agent.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with LangGraph Cloud for initial implementation. The reduced complexity and faster time-to-market far outweigh the marginal cost differences.
