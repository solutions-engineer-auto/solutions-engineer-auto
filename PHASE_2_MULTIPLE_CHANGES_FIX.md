# Phase 2 Multiple Changes Fix Summary

## Issue
User reported that multiple changes were not working - only ONE change would appear when running the test, and `addTestChanges()` appeared to do nothing. The error was:
```
Test failed: RangeError: Applying a mismatched transaction
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing `updateChange` Method
The `DiffExtensionV2` was calling `changeManager.updateChange()` to save validated positions, but this method didn't exist in `ChangeManagerV2`.

**Fix**: Added the `updateChange` method to ChangeManagerV2:
```javascript
updateChange(changeId, updates) {
  const change = this.changes.get(changeId);
  if (!change) return;
  
  Object.assign(change, updates);
  this.notifyListeners('change-updated', change);
}
```

### 2. Position Validation Not Persisted
When `addChange` validated positions to ensure they were within document bounds, it updated a local copy but didn't save these adjustments back to the ChangeManager. This caused stale positions to be used when applying marks.

**Fix**: Added this line after position validation:
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Update the change in the manager with adjusted positions
this.storage.changeManager.updateChange(changeId, {
  position: { from, to }
})
```

### 3. Test Script Position Conflicts
The original test was trying to create changes without properly checking for:
- Valid word boundaries
- Non-overlapping positions
- Document size constraints

**Fix**: Created `test-phase2-multiple-fixed.js` with:
- Proper word boundary detection
- Non-overlapping position tracking
- Position validation before each change
- Better error handling and debugging output

## Results
✅ Multiple changes now work correctly
✅ No more "mismatched transaction" errors
✅ All changes are properly highlighted
✅ Position tracking is accurate

## Key Lessons
1. **Always persist validated data** - Don't just validate locally
2. **ProseMirror uses 0-based indexing** [[memory:2780633]]
3. **Validate positions before every operation** - Document state can change
4. **Non-overlapping changes are easier** - Avoid complexity of overlapping marks

## Test It
Run the fixed test:
```bash
/test-phase2-multiple-fixed.js
```

Or use the helper functions:
```javascript
fixedMultiTest.clear()    // Clear all changes
fixedMultiTest.addOne()   // Add single safe change
fixedMultiTest.debug()    // Show current state
```
