# AI Diff System - Implementation Documentation

## üìö Document Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for implementing an AI-powered document diff system with visual accept/reject functionality, similar to Cursor IDE's approach but tailored for document editing.

**üìå Updated**: Documentation has been revised to clearly separate Frontend responsibilities (our team) from Backend responsibilities (Supabase/Vercel integration team). See [AI_DIFF_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md](./AI_DIFF_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed API contracts.

## üéØ System Overview

### What It Does

The AI Diff System enables users to:
- Request AI-powered edits to specific portions of their documents
- See exactly what changes the AI suggests through visual diffs
- Accept or reject individual changes with full control
- Maintain document integrity while leveraging AI assistance

### Key Features

- **Surgical Precision**: AI only edits selected text, preserving the rest
- **Visual Diff Interface**: Clear visualization of additions, deletions, and modifications
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Efficient review with Tab/Shift+Tab for accept/reject
- **Batch Operations**: Handle multiple changes at once
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Changes sync across all users
- **Full Audit Trail**: Complete history of all changes

**Key Architecture Decision**: Vercel ‚Üí Supabase Split
- Frontend sends requests to Vercel (non-blocking)
- Vercel processes with LangGraph and stores in Supabase
- Frontend subscribes to Supabase for real-time updates
- Provides progressive loading and better error handling

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: React + TipTap Editor with custom diff extension
- **API**: Vercel Functions for serverless endpoints
- **AI**: LangGraph agents with targeted editing capabilities
- **Database**: Supabase with real-time subscriptions
- **Diff Engine**: ProseMirror decorations + diff-match-patch

## üìã Implementation Phases

**Note**: Implementation is divided between Frontend (our team) and Backend (Supabase/Vercel team) with parallel development.

### Phase 1: Frontend Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Text selection and context extraction
- Change management architecture
- API client with mocks

### Phase 2: Core Diff UI (Weeks 3-4)
- TipTap diff visualization extension
- Interactive change widgets
- Keyboard navigation

### Phase 3: API Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- Connect to real backend APIs
- Error handling and recovery
- Real-time updates

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Weeks 7-8)
- Complete test coverage
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run migrations to create diff tables
supabase migration new add_diff_system
# Copy SQL from AI_DIFF_ARCHITECTURE.md
supabase db push
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install diff-match-patch
npm install @tiptap/extension-collaboration
npm install immutable  # For performance optimization
```

### 3. Feature Flag Setup
```typescript
// .env
REACT_APP_ENABLE_DIFF=true

// In code
const DIFF_ENABLED = process.env.REACT_APP_ENABLE_DIFF === 'true';
```

### 4. Basic Integration
```typescript
// Add to your TipTap editor
import { DiffVisualizerExtension } from './extensions/DiffVisualizer';

const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit,
    DIFF_ENABLED ? DiffVisualizerExtension : null
  ].filter(Boolean)
});
```

### Key Decisions to Make

Before starting implementation:

1. **Scope Decision**: Start with paragraph-level edits or sentence-level?
2. **UI Approach**: Inline diffs or side-by-side comparison?
3. **AI Provider**: Primary LLM provider (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)?
4. **Rollout Strategy**: Internal beta first or feature flag to subset?
5. **Performance Budget**: Maximum acceptable latency?

## ‚úÖ Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Review all documentation with team
- [ ] Align on success metrics
- [ ] Choose primary AI provider
- [ ] Set up test environment
