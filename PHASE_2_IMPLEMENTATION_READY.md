# Phase 2 Implementation Resources - Ready to Go! ðŸš€

You now have everything needed to successfully implement Phase 2 of the AI Diff System. Here's what's been prepared:

## ðŸ“š Primary Resources

### 1. **PHASE_2_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md** - Your Main Implementation Guide
- Complete step-by-step implementation plan
- Leverages the existing V2 mark-based approach
- Specific code examples and patterns
- Integration instructions with Phase 1
- Testing strategies

### 2. **PHASE_2_AI_PITFALL_PREVENTION.md** - Pitfall Prevention Guide  
- Common mistakes AI assistants make with overlays
- Specific anti-patterns to avoid
- Correct implementation patterns
- Quick verification tests
- Red flags to watch for

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights Incorporated

1. **Use the existing V2 implementation** - Someone already started with the correct mark-based approach
2. **Marks > Decorations** - Marks move with text automatically, solving position tracking
3. **Missing dependency** - ChangeManager was deleted, needs to be recreated
4. **Test scripts exist** - Use the existing test-v2.js files to verify behavior

## âœ… Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Read both implementation guides thoroughly
- [ ] Review existing V2 code files
- [ ] Run existing test scripts to see current state
- [ ] Fix ChangeManager dependency
- [ ] Complete mark implementation
- [ ] Build overlay system with proper event handling
- [ ] Integrate with Phase 1
- [ ] Test with changing documents

## ðŸ”‘ Success Factors

1. **Trust TipTap's mark system** - Don't try to track positions manually
2. **Use React Portals for overlays** - Keep them in the React tree
3. **Prevent event bubbling** - Use onMouseDown with preventDefault()
4. **Test dynamically** - Always test with changing text
5. **Keep it simple** - The framework does the heavy lifting

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

```bash
# 1. Start by reviewing what exists
npm run dev
open http://localhost:5173/test-v2.html

# 2. Read the existing V2 implementation
cat src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffExtensionV2.js

# 3. Begin implementation following the guides
```

The prompts emphasize building on the existing V2 foundation rather than starting from scratch. This approach leverages work that's already been done while fixing the issues that made it incomplete.

Good luck with the implementation! The mark-based approach is solid - you just need to complete it. ðŸŽ‰
