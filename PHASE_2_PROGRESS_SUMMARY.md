# Phase 2 Progress Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. React 18 Compatibility & React Portals
- **Fixed:** Replaced deprecated `ReactDOM.render()` with `createRoot()`
- **Implemented:** React Portals for better overlay positioning control
- **Result:** Overlays now render outside the editor DOM hierarchy, preventing z-index and clipping issues

### 2. Editor Reference Management
- **Fixed:** Removed stale editor references [[memory:2776291]]
- **Implemented:** Always get editor from command context
- **Result:** No more "docSize=2" or stale reference errors

### 3. Event Handling
- **Fixed:** Changed from `onClick` to `onMouseDown` [[memory:2533006]]
- **Implemented:** Proper `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
- **Result:** No focus loss when interacting with overlays

### 4. Accept/Reject Functionality
- **Fixed:** Accept now applies changes to the document immediately
- **Implemented:** Proper transaction handling for text modifications
- **Result:** Changes are actually applied when accepted, marks removed when rejected

## üîß Current State

### What's Working:
1. ‚úÖ Single highlight appears correctly with visual styling
2. ‚úÖ Click on highlight shows overlay with accept/reject buttons
3. ‚úÖ Accept button applies the change to the document
4. ‚úÖ Reject button removes the highlight
5. ‚úÖ React Portals provide better positioning control
6. ‚úÖ No more transaction errors

### What Needs Work:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple highlights support (partially implemented)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Overlapping marks handling
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Position updates after accepted changes
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration with Phase 1 selection system

## üß™ Test Scripts Created

### 1. `test-phase2-simple.js`
- Basic single change test
- Automated flow from adding change to accepting
- Manual helpers for debugging

### 2. `test-phase2-multiple.js`
- Multiple changes test
- Tests different change types (addition, deletion, modification)
- Batch operations helpers

### 3. `test-phase2-current-state.js`
- Comprehensive state checking
- Verifies all components are loaded
- Debug information output

## üöÄ How to Test

1. Open a document in the editor
2. Open browser console
3. Run one of the test scripts:
   ```javascript
   // Simple test
   /test-phase2-simple.js
   
   // Multiple changes test
   /test-phase2-multiple.js
   
   // Current state check
   /test-phase2-current-state.js
   ```

4. Or use manual testing:
   ```javascript
   // Enable diff mode
   editor.commands.toggleDiffMode()
   
   // Add a change
   editor.commands.addChange({
     type: 'modification',
     originalText: 'old text',
     suggestedText: 'new text',
     position: { from: 10, to: 18 }
   })
   
   // Click the highlight to see overlay
   // Click Accept to apply the change
   ```

## üìä Key Architecture Decisions

1. **React Portals:** Better positioning control and prevents DOM hierarchy issues
2. **Immediate Application:** Changes are applied immediately on accept (per your requirement)
3. **Mark-Based System:** Using TipTap marks for automatic position tracking [[memory:2772251]]
4. **Clean Event Handling:** Using mousedown events to prevent focus issues

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Complete Multiple Changes Support**
   - Handle overlapping marks gracefully
   - Update positions after changes are applied
   - Test with 10+ simultaneous changes

2. **Polish Overlay UI**
   - Match glassmorphic theme more closely
   - Add subtle animations
   - Improve positioning for edge cases

3. **Phase 1 Integration**
   - Connect to SelectionHandler
   - Use ContextBuilder for AI requests
   - Wire up keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + K)

## üí° Important Notes

- The V2 mark-based approach is working correctly
- ChangeManagerV2 was already implemented (not missing)
- The system is ready for Phase 1 integration
- Performance is good with current implementation

## üêõ Known Issues

1. Overlay sometimes appears slightly offset on first click
2. Multiple rapid accepts can cause position drift
3. Marks don't update position after other changes are applied

These are minor issues that can be addressed during polish phase.
