# Phase 3: API Integration Summary

## üöÄ Phase 2 Accomplishments

Phase 2 is now complete with full production-ready functionality:

1. **Visual Diff System** 
   - TipTap marks for automatic position tracking
   - Proper colors: green (addition), red (deletion), cyan (modification)
   - Marks persist through document edits

2. **Interactive UI**
   - Click highlights to show change preview overlay
   - Beautiful glassmorphic design matching app theme
   - Confirm/Decline buttons that modify document correctly

3. **Robust Implementation**
   - Full undo/redo support (marks store original/suggested text)
   - Debug button in toolbar for testing without LLM
   - Position tracking that survives document changes
   - No memory leaks or event handler issues

## üìã Phase 3 Overview

### Goal
Connect the completed diff visualization system to the LangGraph LLM backend to enable actual AI-powered text editing suggestions.

### Key Components to Build

1. **LangGraphEditService**
   - New service to handle API communication
   - Manage streaming responses
   - Parse LLM output into change objects

2. **Instruction Modal**
   - UI for users to specify edit requirements
   - Shows selected text for context
   - Glassmorphic design to match app

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Connect SelectionHandler output to API
   - Map LLM positions to ProseMirror positions
   - Handle loading states and errors

### Technical Challenges

1. **Position Mapping**
   - LLM returns character offsets
   - Need to convert to ProseMirror positions (account for nodes)
   - Must handle position shifts from streaming changes

2. **Streaming Responses**
   - Decide: apply changes as they arrive or batch?
   - Handle partial responses gracefully
   - Maintain UI responsiveness

3. **Error Handling**
   - API failures
   - Invalid/empty responses
   - Position out of bounds errors

## üèÅ Getting Started with Phase 3

### Prerequisites
- Phase 1 & 2 complete ‚úÖ
- Understanding of existing API structure
- Familiarity with Server-Sent Events (SSE)

### First Steps
1. Review `PHASE_3_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md`
2. Study existing API integration in `AIChat` component
3. Create `LangGraphEditService.js`
4. Build instruction modal component
5. Wire up to existing diff system

### Success Metrics
- User can select text ‚Üí request edit ‚Üí see AI suggestions
- Changes appear as diff highlights
- Accept/reject functionality works with real AI suggestions
- Smooth UX with proper loading/error states

## üîó Resources

- **Phase 3 Kickoff**: `PHASE_3_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md`
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/langgraph/`
- **Existing Integration**: `src/components/AIChat/useAIChat.js`
- **Phase 2 System**: `src/extensions/DiffExtension/`

The diff visualization system is rock-solid and ready. Phase 3 is about feeding it intelligent suggestions from the AI.
