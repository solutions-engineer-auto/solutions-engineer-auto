# Editable Document Upload - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a production-ready feature that allows users to upload files directly as editable documents in the Documents section. This complements the existing reference file upload in the Context Files section.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Document Upload Handler (`handleDocumentFileUpload`)
- **Purpose**: Processes uploaded files and creates editable documents
- **Features**:
  - Prompts user for document title (defaults to filename)
  - Converts file to HTML using existing `documentProcessor`
  - Creates new document in `documents` table
  - Auto-navigates to document editor after creation
  - Proper error handling throughout

### 2. UI Integration in Documents Section
- **Location**: Added "Upload Document for Editing" subsection in Documents panel
- **Components**:
  - Reuses existing `FileUploadDropzone` component
  - Clear labeling to distinguish from reference uploads
  - Dedicated progress indicator for document uploads
  - Maintains volcanic beach theme consistency

### 3. Database Integration
- **Table**: Saves to `documents` table (not `account_data_sources`)
- **Fields Set**:
  - `title`: User-provided title
  - `content`: HTML-converted file content
  - `document_type`: null (as requested)
  - `account_id`: Current account
  - `author_id`: Current user
  - `status`: 'draft'

## Key Features

### User Experience
- **Clear Separation**: Distinct sections for editable vs reference uploads
- **Intuitive Flow**: Upload → Title → Process → Edit
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators with meaningful messages
- **Smart Defaults**: Filename (without extension) as default title

### Technical Excellence
- **Code Reuse**: Leverages existing components and services
- **Clean Architecture**: No duplication of logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios covered
- **Performance**: Client-side processing for speed

### Production Readiness
- ✅ Build passes without errors
- ✅ All file types supported (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, RTF)
- ✅ Proper authentication checks
- ✅ Database operations with error handling
- ✅ Consistent with existing UI/UX patterns

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Reused Components**: Used existing `FileUploadDropzone` and `documentProcessor`
2. **Separate Handlers**: Different handlers for documents vs reference files
3. **Progress State**: Shared progress state with message-based filtering
4. **Direct Navigation**: Auto-navigate to editor for immediate editing

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Navigate to any account's detail page
2. In the Documents section, find "Upload Document for Editing"
3. Drag & drop or click to upload a document
4. Enter a title when prompted
5. Wait for processing
6. Automatically opens in the document editor

### For Developers
```javascript
// The handler can be reused for other document upload scenarios
const handleDocumentFileUpload = async (files) => {
  // Process file
  // Create document
  // Navigate to editor
}
```
