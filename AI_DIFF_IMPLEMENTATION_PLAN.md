# AI Diff System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a phased implementation approach for the AI-powered document diff system. The plan is designed to deliver value incrementally while managing technical complexity and dependencies. **This plan has been updated to reflect the division of responsibilities between the frontend team (our scope) and the backend team (Supabase/Vercel integration).**

## Team Responsibilities

### Frontend Team (Our Scope)
- Text selection and context extraction
- Diff visualization components
- Change management UI
- API client implementation (Vercel endpoints)
- Supabase subscription handling
- User interaction flows

### Backend Team (Their Scope)
- Vercel API implementation
- LangGraph agent integration
- Supabase database schema
- Data persistence logic
- Authentication & authorization

### Architecture Pattern
We use a **Vercel → Supabase split architecture**:
1. Frontend sends AI requests to Vercel Functions
2. Vercel processes with LangGraph and stores in Supabase
3. Frontend receives real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
4. This provides non-blocking requests and progressive updates

## Implementation Timeline

**Total Duration**: 8-10 weeks (reduced from 12-16 due to parallel backend work)
- **Phase 1**: Frontend Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Core Diff UI (Weeks 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: API Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- **Phase 4**: Polish & Testing (Weeks 7-8)
- **Buffer**: 2 weeks for integration issues

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Frontend-Specific Risks
1. **Position Tracking in TipTap**
   - Risk: ProseMirror positions change after edits
   - Mitigation: Use stable node IDs and position mapping
   - Contingency: Re-calculate positions on each change

2. **API Contract Changes**
   - Risk: Backend team changes API format
   - Mitigation: Version API contracts, use TypeScript interfaces
   - Contingency: Adapter layer for API changes

3. **Performance with Many Decorations**
   - Risk: TipTap slows down with 100+ diff decorations
   - Mitigation: Virtual rendering, decoration batching
   - Contingency: Paginate changes, show max 50 at once

### Integration Risks
1. **Backend API Delays**
   - Risk: APIs not ready when needed
   - Mitigation: Continue using mocks, parallel development
   - Contingency: Extend timeline by 1-2 weeks

2. **Real-time Sync Complexity**
   - Risk: Concurrent edits cause conflicts
   - Mitigation: Optimistic UI updates, conflict resolution
   - Contingency: Disable real-time, use polling
