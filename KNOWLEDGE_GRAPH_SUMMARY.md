# Knowledge Graph Feature - Executive Summary

## Vision

Transform the static "Context Files" list into an interactive, visual knowledge graph that makes the AI's intelligence tangible and demonstrates how uploaded documents actively power the system. The graph will be displayed in two strategic locations for maximum impact.

## Dual Placement Strategy

### 1. ProspectDetailPage - Account Knowledge View
- **Location**: Replaces the "Context Files" section with toggle between list/graph view
- **Purpose**: Manage and visualize account-specific documents
- **Features**: Drag-and-drop upload, real-time AI access visualization, document relationships

### 2. AccountDashboard - Global Knowledge View  
- **Location**: Below the accounts grid
- **Purpose**: Showcase company-wide knowledge assets
- **Features**: Visualize shared templates, best practices, and organizational knowledge
- **Value**: Demonstrates the power of collective intelligence across all accounts

## Key Concepts

### 1. Visual Knowledge Base
- Documents appear as nodes in a 3D graph
- Connections show semantic relationships
- Real-time visualization of AI accessing knowledge
- Drag-and-drop uploads with instant integration

### 2. Two-Tier Knowledge System
- **Account Knowledge**: Client-specific documents
- **Global Knowledge**: Company-wide templates and standards
- Visual distinction between knowledge types
- Clear value proposition for each tier

### 3. Intelligence Made Visible
- See which documents the AI accesses in real-time
- Watch new documents find their place in the knowledge space
- Understand relationships between information
- Track knowledge usage and value

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Mock Visualization (Week 1)
- Build complete UI with mock data
- Validate UX concepts
- Get stakeholder buy-in
- No dependency on RAG infrastructure

### Phase 2: Embedding Pipeline (Week 2)  
- Integrate OpenAI embeddings
- Calculate real semantic relationships
- Store vectors in enhanced database schema

### Phase 3: RAG Integration (Week 3)
- Connect to Supabase pgvector
- Show real-time document access
- Live relationship updates

### Phase 4: Global Knowledge & Polish (Week 4)
- Add company-wide knowledge base
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced interactions

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
- `KnowledgeGraph`: Main visualization using react-force-graph-3d
- `GraphProcessor`: Handles document processing and embeddings
- `GraphRenderer`: Manages rendering optimizations
- `KnowledgeAccessIndicator`: Shows real-time AI activity

### Backend Enhancements
- Add `embedding` column to `account_data_sources`
- New `document_relationships` table
- New `global_knowledge_base` table
- pgvector for similarity search

### Data Flow
1. User drops file onto graph
2. File processed â†’ embedding generated
3. Relationships calculated with existing documents
4. Node appears with animated integration
5. AI access creates real-time pulses

## Key Benefits

### For Users
- **Immediate Understanding**: See how documents connect
- **Clear Value**: Watch AI actively use their uploads
- **Intuitive Interface**: Drag, drop, and explore
- **Trust Building**: Transparency in AI reasoning

### For Demos
- **"Wow" Factor**: Impressive 3D visualization
- **Tangible AI**: Makes abstract concepts concrete
- **Clear ROI**: Shows value of document uploads
- **Competitive Edge**: Unique visualization approach

## Implementation Details

### Documents Created
1. **Architecture Analysis**: Deep dive into current system
2. **System Design**: Complete technical specification
3. **Implementation Plan**: Phased approach with timelines
4. **Mock Development Guide**: How to build without RAG
5. **Integration Challenges**: Anticipated issues and solutions

### Resource Requirements
- 1 Senior Frontend Developer (4 weeks)
- Backend support for embeddings/API
- OpenAI API budget (~$200/month)
- Supabase pgvector enabled

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with mock data to validate concept
- Phased rollout to manage complexity
- Performance optimizations built-in
- Fallback to list view if needed

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Graph loads in < 2 seconds
- 60fps smooth interactions
- 90% embedding accuracy
- < 100ms real-time updates

### Qualitative
- Users understand value immediately
- Increases document upload rate
- Enhances trust in AI system
- Creates memorable demo experience

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review and approve plan
2. **Week 1**: Build mock visualization
3. **Week 2**: Add embedding pipeline
4. **Week 3**: Integrate with RAG
5. **Week 4**: Polish and optimize

## Conclusion

The Knowledge Graph feature transforms how users perceive and interact with the AI's context system. By making intelligence visible and tangible, we create a powerful differentiator that enhances both user understanding and demo impact.

This comprehensive planning package provides everything needed to build this feature successfully, with clear phases that deliver value incrementally while managing technical complexity.
