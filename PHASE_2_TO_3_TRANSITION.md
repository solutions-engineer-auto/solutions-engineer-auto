# Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3 Transition Guide

## âœ… Phase 2 Complete!

### What We Built
A production-ready visual diff system with:
- **TipTap marks** for automatic position tracking (not decorations!)
- **Interactive overlays** with accept/reject functionality
- **Proper undo/redo** support with data persistence
- **Debug button** for testing without LLM integration

### Key Technical Wins
1. Avoided common pitfalls by using marks instead of decorations
2. Stored change data in mark attributes for resilience
3. React Portals for proper overlay positioning
4. Comprehensive test coverage

## ðŸš€ Phase 3: Making It Intelligent

### The Vision
```
Select Text â†’ Press Cmd+K â†’ "Make it more formal" â†’ See AI Suggestions â†’ Accept/Reject
```

### What Phase 3 Adds
- **LangGraph API Integration**: Connect to the AI backend
- **Instruction Modal**: Beautiful UI for user to specify edits
- **Streaming Support**: Handle real-time AI responses
- **Smart Parsing**: Convert AI suggestions to diff changes

### Key Files for Phase 3

**Start Here:**
- `PHASE_3_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md` - Your implementation guide
- `src/components/AIChat/useAIChat.js` - Example of existing API integration
- `api/langgraph/` - API endpoints to integrate with

**Build These:**
- `src/services/LangGraphEditService.js` - API communication layer
- `src/components/InstructionModal.jsx` - User input UI
- Integration code in `DocumentEditorPage.jsx`

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# 1. Review the Phase 3 kickoff prompt
cat PHASE_3_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md

# 2. Study existing AI Chat integration
cat src/components/AIChat/useAIChat.js

# 3. Create the new service
touch src/services/LangGraphEditService.js

# 4. Start implementing!
npm run dev
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] User can select text and press Cmd+K
- [ ] Instruction modal appears
- [ ] AI suggestions appear as diff marks
- [ ] Accept/reject works with real AI changes
- [ ] Smooth UX with loading states

## ðŸŽ¯ Remember

- **The diff system is solid** - Focus on feeding it good data
- **Follow existing patterns** - AI Chat shows how to integrate
- **Start simple** - Get one edit working end-to-end first
- **Test with the debug button** - Verify changes before API integration
