### 4. Error Handling
- [ ] Test with invalid API key
  - [ ] Set `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` to "invalid-key"
  - [ ] Try all three features above
  - [ ] Verify appropriate error messages appear
- [ ] Test rate limiting
  - [ ] Send multiple rapid requests
  - [ ] Verify exponential backoff works
- [ ] Test network errors
  - [ ] Disconnect internet
  - [ ] Try AI features
  - [ ] Verify error messages appear

## Common Issues & Solutions

### API Key Not Working
1. Check `.env` file exists in project root
2. Ensure key starts with `sk-`
3. Restart dev server after adding key
4. Check browser console for specific errors

### Streaming Not Working
1. Verify you're seeing character-by-character output
2. Check network tab for EventSource connections
3. Look for console errors about streams

### Rate Limiting
- The integration includes automatic retry with exponential backoff
- If you hit rate limits, wait a minute and try again

## Notes
- This is a "hacky" branch implementation as requested
- All AI features use the same OpenAI service module
- Streaming is implemented for better UX
- Error handling and retry logic included
