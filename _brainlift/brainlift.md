### **Product Vision and Goal**

The primary goal is to create an AI agent that assists **solutions engineers** by automating the creation of technical and sales-related documents. The tool aims to bring the "Cursor-like" experience of an AI-powered, context-aware assistant to the solutions engineering industry. It should function like an "AI intern" that can be given access to project materials and then autonomously generate necessary documentation, turning a multi-hour process into a much faster one. The core value proposition is to significantly reduce the repetitive and time-consuming work of creating integration playbooks, solution designs, and other client-facing or internal documents. The agent should be autonomous, capable of understanding context, and able to manage multi-step processes on its own.

### **Market Research and Competitive Landscape**

Your research indicates that while many tools touch upon aspects of this problem, none offer a complete, agentic solution specifically for this use case, creating a significant market opportunity. The competitive landscape is broken down into four main categories:

* **General AI Document Assistants (e.g., Humata, Claude)**: These tools can analyze and summarize documents but lack deep Salesforce integration, technical awareness, and the ability to perform multi-step agentic workflows.

* **Salesforce AI Tools (e.g., Einstein GPT/Copilot)**: Salesforce's native AI tools focus on CRM data and do not have the capability to read external technical documents like PDFs or API specs to generate integration plans.

* **Integration/Middleware Platforms (e.g., MuleSoft, Workato)**: These platforms are focused on the *execution* of integrations, not the *generation* of human-readable documentation or onboarding plans.

* **Pre-Sales Enablement Tools (e.g., ScopeStack)**: These tools help generate proposals or statements of work but are generally template-based and do not use AI to parse technical documents deeply.

The key market gap is for a product that deeply integrates with Salesforce metadata, reads unstructured technical and onboarding documents, and uses an AI agent to auto-generate comprehensive integration plans and playbooks.

### **Core Features and User Flow**

The group decided on a user flow that begins after a user logs in:

1. **Account Selection**: The user sees a list of their accounts or prospects, which they can select to view details. The UI should be designed to get the engineer to the documents they need as quickly as possible.

2. **Account Dashboard**: After selecting an account, the user is presented with a dashboard showing the prospect's current stage in the sales funnel.

3. **Document Hub**: The dashboard displays proposed or in-progress documents relevant to the prospect's current stage. It will show a list of documents, including those already generated, sent to Salesforce, or approved.

4. **AI Interaction**: The user interacts with the AI agent, which has access to all relevant context (emails, CRM data, templates). The agent can suggest, generate, and revise documents through a conversational interface. A key feature is the "human in the loop," where the AI can ask for feedback or clarification before proceeding.

5. **Document Editing and Finalizing**: Generated documents appear in an editor where the engineer can make final edits before saving and exporting them. The MVP will not require a complex collaborative editor. The final step for the MVP will be saving the document as a PDF.

### **Technical and Architectural Decisions**

A consensus was reached on the following technology stack and architecture:

* **Frontend**: A **React-based** application was chosen for its interactivity and ability to handle client-side state.

* **Backend**: **Supabase** will be used for the database, leveraging its underlying **PostgreSQL** instance. This choice provides a solid foundation for an MVP and can be scaled or migrated if needed. Using a simple Postgres-based backend was chosen for the MVP over more complex solutions involving Redis caching.

* **AI Agent**: The AI agent will be built using a framework like **LangGraph**. The agent must be able to manage its own context, deciding which information to pull from various sources to complete its tasks. It will maintain an internal "summary document" or "context log" for each prospect to track state and progress, keeping this internal context separate from the main CRM. The agent should also be able to dynamically switch between different LLMs (e.g., a faster, cheaper model for simple tasks and a more powerful model for complex generation).

* **Data and Document Format**: Documents will be generated and edited in **Markdown** for the MVP due to its simplicity and strong support in AI/LLM tooling. The potential need for

  **DOCX** to handle complex corporate styling was noted as a future consideration but ultimately deferred.

* **Salesforce Integration**: For the MVP, the team decided to **defer a live Salesforce integration**. Instead, they will use mock data that simulates the structured output from Salesforce, such as a "prospect summary" text document. This approach isolates the core application from the complexity of a live API integration, which can be added later. The system will treat Salesforce as a

  **read-only** data source initially to avoid the complexity of state management and write-backs.

### **Implementation Strategy: Phased Rollout**

The team agreed on a pragmatic, phased implementation plan to deliver value quickly and de-risk the project. This strategy is explicitly designed to start with a simple, functional version and add complexity in later phases.

* **Phase 1 & 2: Backend and Core Data**: The initial focus will be on setting up the Supabase backend, defining the database schema, and connecting the existing frontend UI to live data for account and document management.  
* **Phase 3: Polling-Based AI**: To get the AI agent working end-to-end quickly, the initial integration will use a simple **polling mechanism**. The frontend will periodically check the Supabase database for updates to the document being edited by the AI. This avoids the complexity of WebSockets and real-time connections in the early stages.  
* **Phase 4: Real-time Updates**: Once the core logic is proven, the polling system will be replaced with **Supabase Realtime**. This will provide instantaneous updates in the UI as the AI agent works, creating a more seamless and impressive user experience. The refactoring effort is expected to be minimal and isolated to a specific data-fetching hook.  
* **MVP Scope**: The MVP will focus on generating a single document based on mocked Salesforce data. Features like multi-user collaboration, advanced editing with version history, and direct write-backs to Salesforce are explicitly post-MVP.
