# 🎉 Phase 2 Milestone: Colors Working!

## What We Accomplished

### The Problem
All diff marks were showing as green regardless of type (addition, deletion, modification) because the mark attributes were undefined.

### The Fix
Discovered that TipTap pre-processes attributes through `renderHTML` functions:
- Attributes arrive as `data-diff-type` not `type`
- Updated DiffMark.js to read `HTMLAttributes['data-diff-type']`
- Used `mergeAttributes` helper for proper attribute handling

### The Result
✅ **Green** highlights for additions
✅ **Red** highlights with strikethrough for deletions  
✅ **Cyan** highlights for modifications

## What's Next: Making Them Interactive

Currently the marks are visual-only. Next steps:

1. **Click Handlers** - Make marks clickable to show overlay
2. **Overlay Positioning** - Show accept/reject buttons near clicked text
3. **Accept/Reject Logic** - Actually apply or revert the changes
4. **Position Updates** - Update other marks after operations

## Quick Test

Run this to test the current state:
```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = '/test-overlay-next.js';
document.body.appendChild(script);
```

Then try:
- Click on highlighted text (currently won't do anything)
- Run `showOverlay()` to manually test overlay functionality

## The Journey So Far

1. ✅ Phase 1 Complete - Selection handling, position tracking
2. ✅ Phase 2 Started - Found existing V2 implementation  
3. ✅ Created ChangeManagerV2 - Fixed missing dependency
4. ✅ Fixed mark colors - Proper visual differentiation
5. ⏳ Next: Make them interactive!

## Technical Achievement

This fix demonstrates deep understanding of TipTap's internals:
- How marks process attributes
- The difference between raw attributes and rendered HTML attributes
- Proper use of TipTap's helper functions

We're building on solid foundations now! 🏗️
