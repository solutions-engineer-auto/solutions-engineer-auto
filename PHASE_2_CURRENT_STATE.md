# AI Diff System - Phase 2 Current State

## üîç You Were Right to Double-Check!

Phase 2 has been **partially implemented** but is currently in an incomplete/experimental state. Here's what exists:

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented from Phase 2

### 1. **DiffExtensionV2** (`src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffExtensionV2.js`)
- Complete rewrite using TipTap marks instead of decorations
- Commands for adding/accepting/rejecting changes
- Batch operations support
- Toggle diff mode functionality

### 2. **DiffMark** (`src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffMark.js`)
- Visual highlighting using TipTap's native mark system
- Three diff types: addition (green), deletion (red), modification (cyan)
- Reliable position tracking (marks move with text automatically)
- Custom styling with data attributes

### 3. **DiffOverlay** (`src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffOverlay.js`)
- Interactive accept/reject buttons
- Positioned above marked text when clicked
- Clean UI with glassmorphic styling
- Handles click events and actions

### 4. **Test Scripts** (in `public/` directory)
- `test-mark-based-v2.js` - Tests the new mark system
- `demo.js` and `demo-fixed.js` - Demo implementations
- Shows the system partially working

## ‚ùå What's Missing/Broken

### 1. **ChangeManager Service** 
- Was deleted (`src/services/ChangeManager.js` in deleted files list)
- DiffExtensionV2 expects this but it doesn't exist
- This breaks the entire system

### 2. **Integration**
- DiffExtensionV2 is not integrated into DocumentEditorPage
- The original DiffExtension (Phase 1) is what would be loaded

### 3. **Real Change Tracking**
- No actual connection to AI responses
- No persistence of changes
- No real-time sync

## ü§î Why This Happened

It appears someone started implementing Phase 2 with a better approach (using marks instead of decorations), but:
1. Didn't complete the ChangeManager service
2. Didn't integrate it with the main editor
3. Left it in an experimental state

## üí° Current Architecture Decision

The V2 implementation made a **smart architectural choice**:
- **Decorations** (original plan) ‚Üí unreliable position tracking
- **Marks** (V2 approach) ‚Üí native TipTap feature, positions update automatically

This solves the position tracking issues more elegantly!

## üéØ To Test What Exists

You can test the partial Phase 2 implementation:

1. Load the test script in browser console:
```javascript
// Copy the contents of public/test-mark-based-v2.js
// Or load it as a script tag
```

2. The test will try to:
   - Enable diff mode
   - Add test changes
   - Show visual highlights
   - Allow clicking for accept/reject

**BUT** it will fail because ChangeManager doesn't exist.

## üìä Actual Current State Summary

| Component | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Status |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Selection Handler | ‚úÖ | - | Working |
| Context Builder | ‚úÖ | - | Working |
| Position Tracking | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ (better) | Both approaches exist |
| Visual Diff Display | ‚ùå | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Partially implemented |
| Accept/Reject UI | ‚ùå | ‚ö†Ô∏è | UI exists, logic missing |
| Change Management | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Service deleted |
| API Integration | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Not started |

## üöÄ Recommendation

The Phase 2 V2 approach (using marks) is **technically superior** to the original plan:

1. **Marks** automatically handle position updates
2. Cleaner implementation
3. More reliable than decorations

However, it needs:
1. ChangeManager service implementation
2. Integration with the main editor
3. Connection to Phase 1's selection handler
4. Testing and debugging

**Should we:**
- A) Continue with the V2 mark-based approach?
- B) Go back to the original decoration plan?
- C) Start Phase 2 fresh with lessons learned?

The foundation exists but needs completion!
