# Phase 2 Completion Summary

## Issue Found and Fixed

### Problem
When pressing Cmd+D or Ctrl+D to toggle diff mode, the following error occurred:
```
Uncaught TypeError: this.updateMarks is not a function
    at DiffExtensionV2.js:71:16
```

### Root Cause
In TipTap extensions, helper methods defined at the extension level aren't automatically bound to the proper context. When `this.updateMarks()` was called in the `onCreate` hook, `this` referred to the extension configuration object, not the runtime instance with access to storage and editor.

### Solution Applied
1. Moved all helper methods (`updateMarks`, `applyMarkForChange`, `updateMarkStatus`) into the storage object during the `onCreate` hook
2. Captured the extension context with `const extension = this`
3. Updated all method calls to use `this.storage.methodName()` instead of `this.methodName()`
4. Removed the original method definitions from the extension object

### Files Modified
- `src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffExtensionV2.js` - Fixed context binding for helper methods
- `src/pages/DocumentEditorPage.jsx` - Added editor exposure to window for debugging
- `public/test-phase2-integration.js` - Created comprehensive test script

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: Cmd+D/Ctrl+D now toggles diff mode without errors
✅ **Working**: Basic extension structure and command system
✅ **Available**: Test script for verifying functionality

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open the document editor** at `/accounts/{accountId}/documents/{docId}`

2. **Open browser console** and run:
   ```javascript
   // Load the test script
   const script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = '/test-phase2-integration.js';
   document.head.appendChild(script);
   ```

3. **Use the test commands**:
   ```javascript
   // Toggle diff mode
   diffTest.toggle()
   
   // Enable diff mode
   diffTest.enable()
   
   // Add a test change
   diffTest.addChange()
   
   // Check for diff marks
   diffTest.checkMarks()
   
   // Run full integration test
   diffTest.fullFlow()
   
   // Add multiple test changes
   diffTest.addTestChanges()
   ```

4. **Manual testing**:
   - Press Cmd+D (Mac) or Ctrl+D (Windows/Linux) to toggle diff mode
   - Select text and press Cmd+K to trigger AI edit request (if integrated)
   - Click on highlighted text to see accept/reject buttons
   - Use `diffTest.acceptFirst()` or `diffTest.rejectFirst()` to test actions

## Next Steps

The foundation is now working. The next tasks are:

1. **Verify DiffOverlay functionality** - Ensure overlays appear when clicking diff marks
2. **Test mark persistence** - Verify marks stay in correct positions during editing  
3. **Connect to Phase 1** - Wire up the selection system to create actual diff marks
4. **Style refinement** - Ensure visual consistency with the app's glassmorphic theme
5. **Edge case testing** - Test with empty documents, overlapping changes, rapid edits

## Known Limitations

- DiffOverlay click handling may need adjustment
- Integration with Phase 1's SelectionHandler not yet implemented
- No persistence of changes between sessions
- Mock data only - no real AI integration yet

## Architecture Notes

The V2 implementation correctly uses TipTap marks instead of decorations, which provides:
- Automatic position tracking as text changes
- Native integration with TipTap's transaction system
- Better performance with many changes
- Simpler code with fewer edge cases

The mark-based approach [[memory:2772251]] is the right architectural choice and should be maintained going forward.
