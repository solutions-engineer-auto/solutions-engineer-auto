# Phase 2: Current State & Next Steps

## 🎉 What's Working Now

### Visual Highlights ✅
- **Cyan underline** appears on modified text (you saw it on "TEMPLATE:")
- Marks use TipTap's native system (like bold/italic)
- Highlights stay in correct position as text changes
- CSS styles are properly injected and visible

### Technical Foundation ✅
- Fixed the stale editor reference issue [[memory:2776291]]
- ChangeManagerV2 service is working
- DiffExtensionV2 with proper mark commands
- DiffMark renders with correct styles
- No more "position 2" errors when document is large

### Key Fixes Applied
1. **Dynamic editor reference** - Always get current editor, never store it
2. **Removed double application** - Disabled automatic subscription to prevent conflicts
3. **Proper change object handling** - Get complete change with ID before applying mark

## 🚧 What Still Needs Work

### 1. Click Interaction
The marks are visible but not yet clickable. Need to:
- Add click event handlers to marks
- Show DiffOverlay with accept/reject buttons
- Position overlay relative to clicked mark

### 2. Multiple Marks
Currently works for single marks, need to test:
- Multiple changes in document
- Overlapping changes
- Batch change application

### 3. Integration with Phase 1
- Connect to SelectionHandler from Phase 1
- Wire up the Cmd+K keyboard shortcut
- Handle real AI responses (currently using mock data)

## 🧪 Testing the Current State

### Refresh the page first (important!), then run:
```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = '/test-phase2-clean.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

### What you should see:
1. ✅ Cyan underline on "TEMPLATE:" 
2. ✅ Hover effect (brightness change)
3. ✅ Console shows mark details
4. ❌ No accept/reject buttons yet (next step)

### Helper commands available:
- `diffClean.reset()` - Clear all changes
- `diffClean.info()` - Show current state

## 📝 Next Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Make Marks Clickable
```javascript
// In DiffMark or via event delegation
element.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  if (e.target.matches('[data-change-id]')) {
    const changeId = e.target.dataset.changeId;
    // Show overlay for this change
  }
});
```

### Step 2: Complete DiffOverlay
- Fix the JSX version to use React properly
- Position overlay near clicked mark
- Handle accept/reject actions

### Step 3: Re-enable Smart Updates
Once click handling works, carefully re-enable:
- Batch updates
- Real-time synchronization
- Subscription system (without double application)

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- [x] Marks appear visually
- [x] Correct colors (green/red/cyan)
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Positions stay correct
- [ ] Click shows overlay
- [ ] Accept/reject works
- [ ] Multiple marks work
- [ ] Integrates with Phase 1

## 💡 Key Insights Learned

1. **Marks > Decorations** - Always use marks for persistent highlights
2. **Dynamic References** - Never store editor references during initialization
3. **Test First** - Manual testing scripts catch issues early
4. **Incremental Progress** - Get one mark working before adding complexity

The foundation is solid now. The visual highlights work! Next step is making them interactive.
