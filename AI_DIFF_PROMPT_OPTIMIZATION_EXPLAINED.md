# AI Diff Prompt Optimization Techniques Explained

## How This Prompt is Optimized for Claude Opus

### 1. **XML Tags for Structure** üèóÔ∏è
The entire prompt uses XML tags to separate different types of information:
- `<role>` - Establishes expertise
- `<critical_context>` - Core understanding
- `<existing_system>` - What already works
- `<code_patterns>` - Exact patterns to follow

**Why it works**: Claude is specifically trained to pay special attention to XML-structured content.

### 2. **Role Assignment at the Start** üë®‚Äçüíª
```xml
<role>
You are an elite Senior React/TypeScript Developer with 10+ years of experience...
</role>
```

**Why it works**: Giving Claude a specific expert identity improves response quality and consistency.

### 3. **Concrete Code Examples** üìù
Instead of describing patterns, the prompt includes actual code snippets:
- Success notification pattern
- Supabase realtime pattern
- Position validation pattern

**Why it works**: Claude performs much better with concrete examples than abstract descriptions.

### 4. **Thinking Section Included** ü§î
```xml
<thinking>
Let me analyze this implementation...
</thinking>
```

**Why it works**: This gives Claude space to reason through the problem before responding.

### 5. **Critical Instructions at the End** üéØ
The `<your_task>` section with specific implementation steps comes last.

**Why it works**: Claude gives more weight to instructions at the end of long prompts.

### 6. **Explicit Anti-Patterns** ‚ùå
```xml
<common_pitfalls>
1. POSITION TRACKING
   - Error: Using stored positions without validation
   - Correct: Always use findMarkPositionById()
```

**Why it works**: Telling Claude what NOT to do prevents common mistakes.

### 7. **Phased Implementation** üìÖ
Clear phases with specific deliverables:
- Phase 1: Mock AI Integration
- Phase 2: Real Agent Integration
- Phase 3: Position Accuracy & Polish

**Why it works**: Breaking complex tasks into steps improves accuracy.

### 8. **Test-Driven Approach** üß™
```xml
<testing_approach>
const testScenarios = [
  'empty selection',
  'special characters: "quotes", <tags>, \\slashes',
  ...
]
```

**Why it works**: Concrete test cases ensure thorough implementation.

### 9. **Context About What Works** ‚úÖ
```xml
THE DIFF VISUALIZATION ALREADY WORKS PERFECTLY. You're just connecting AI to it.
```

**Why it works**: This prevents Claude from reimplementing working systems.

### 10. **Memory References** üß†
Uses specific memory IDs and patterns from the codebase analysis.

**Why it works**: Leverages Claude's ability to use contextual memories.

## Quick Tips for Using This Prompt

1. **Don't modify the XML structure** - It's optimized for Claude's training
2. **Keep all code examples** - They anchor Claude's understanding
3. **Maintain the phase structure** - It guides systematic implementation
4. **Include the thinking section** - It improves reasoning quality

## Expected Outcome

When you use this prompt, Claude should:
1. Start by creating ChangeManagerV2.js
2. Follow the exact patterns shown
3. Test at each step
4. Avoid all the common pitfalls
5. Deliver working code that integrates perfectly with your existing system

This prompt leverages every optimization technique discovered for Claude Opus to ensure the highest quality implementation possible.
