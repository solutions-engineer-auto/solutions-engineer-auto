2. **[KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md](./KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md)**
   - Deep dive into current system architecture
   - Analysis of integration points
   - Identifies what needs to change

3. **[KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](./KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md)**
   - Complete technical specification
   - Component designs and interfaces
   - Database schema and API design

4. **[KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)**
   - Phased implementation approach
   - Week-by-week breakdown
   - Success criteria and milestones

### Development Guides

5. **[KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_MOCK_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_MOCK_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)**
   - How to build with mock data first
   - Complete mock data structures
   - Enables parallel development

6. **[KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_INTEGRATION_CHALLENGES.md](./KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_INTEGRATION_CHALLENGES.md)**
   - Anticipated technical challenges
   - Detailed solutions and workarounds
   - Performance optimization strategies

## Quick Decision Guide

### For Executives/Stakeholders
Start with: **KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SUMMARY.md**

### For Technical Leads
Read in order:
1. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md
2. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
3. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

### For Developers
Essential reading:
1. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
2. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_MOCK_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
3. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_INTEGRATION_CHALLENGES.md

### For Project Managers
Focus on:
1. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SUMMARY.md (executive overview)

## Recent Updates

### Dual Placement Strategy (Latest)
The Knowledge Graph has been updated to appear in TWO locations:
1. **ProspectDetailPage**: Replaces "Context Files" section with toggle between list/graph view
2. **AccountDashboard**: New section below accounts grid showing company-wide knowledge base

Key changes:
- Updated `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_ULTIMATE_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md` with AccountDashboard integration
- Enhanced `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` with dual placement architecture
- Modified `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SUMMARY.md` to highlight both placement locations
- Updated `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with tasks for both integrations
- Created new migration `20250111_add_is_global_to_data_sources.sql` for global vs account knowledge

This dual approach maximizes the value of the knowledge graph by:
- Showing account-specific knowledge where it's managed (ProspectDetailPage)
- Showcasing organizational knowledge assets on the main dashboard
- Demonstrating both individual and collective intelligence

## Key Takeaways

âœ… **Feasible**: Can be built incrementally without disrupting existing features

âœ… **Valuable**: Makes AI intelligence visible and tangible for users

âœ… **Scalable**: Architecture supports growth from 10 to 10,000+ documents

âœ… **Flexible**: Can start with mocks and add real functionality later

âœ… **Demo-Ready**: Week 1 delivers a working prototype for stakeholder demos

## Next Actions

1. Review documentation package
2. Approve implementation plan
3. Allocate resources
4. Begin Phase 1 (Mock Visualization)
