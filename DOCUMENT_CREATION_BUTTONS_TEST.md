# Document Creation Buttons Test Checklist

## Implementation Summary
- Split "Generate New Document" button into three distinct buttons:
  1. **Generate Document** (AI) - Disabled placeholder
  2. **Create Empty Document** - Current functionality
  3. **Create from Template** - Existing functionality

## Visual Tests

### Desktop View
- [ ] All three buttons appear in the Documents section header
- [ ] Buttons have 16px spacing between them (space-x-3 class)
- [ ] Buttons are right-aligned in the header
- [ ] AI Generate button has primary style but 50% opacity
- [ ] Create Empty and Template buttons have secondary (volcanic) style
- [ ] All buttons have appropriate icons:
  - AI: Sparkles/magic icon
  - Empty: Document with lines icon
  - Template: Document icon with count badge

### Mobile View
- [ ] Buttons remain horizontal on small screens
- [ ] Buttons wrap if needed on very small screens
- [ ] Spacing remains consistent
- [ ] All text and icons remain visible

### Empty State
- [ ] When no documents exist, buttons appear in centered layout
- [ ] Buttons stack vertically on mobile (flex-col sm:flex-row)
- [ ] Same button styles and states as header buttons
- [ ] Buttons centered below "No documents generated yet" message

## Functional Tests

### AI Generate Button
- [ ] Button is disabled (cursor shows not-allowed)
- [ ] Clicking does nothing visible to user
- [ ] Console logs "AI generation coming soon!" (for dev verification)
- [ ] Tooltip appears on hover: "Coming soon: AI-powered generation"
- [ ] Tooltip positioned correctly above button
- [ ] Tooltip disappears when hover ends

### Create Empty Document Button
- [ ] Clicking opens DocumentCreationModal
- [ ] Modal asks for document title
- [ ] Creating document navigates to editor
- [ ] Loading state shows spinner and "Creating..." text
- [ ] Button is disabled during creation process
- [ ] Works in both header and empty state locations

### Create from Template Button
- [ ] Only appears when templates exist in data sources
- [ ] Shows count badge with number of templates
- [ ] Clicking opens TemplateSelectionModal
- [ ] Template selection and creation works as before
- [ ] Badge updates when templates are added/removed

## Accessibility Tests

- [ ] All buttons have descriptive text labels
- [ ] Disabled button has title attribute for screen readers
- [ ] Tab navigation works through all buttons
- [ ] Enter/Space activates buttons appropriately
- [ ] Focus states are visible

## Theme Consistency

- [ ] Buttons follow volcanic beach theme:
  - Primary: Lava orange gradient
  - Secondary: White/gray borders with hover states
- [ ] Glass morphism effects on hover
- [ ] Smooth transitions on all interactions
- [ ] Icons match text color

## Edge Cases

- [ ] No templates: Template button hidden, layout adjusts
- [ ] Many templates: Badge shows correct count (test with 9+)
- [ ] Long account names don't break button layout
- [ ] Rapid clicking doesn't cause multiple modals
- [ ] Navigation away and back preserves button states

## Developer Notes

### Implementation Details
- Modified `ProspectDetailPage.jsx` only
- No new components created
- Reuses existing `DocumentCreationModal`
- AI functionality intentionally left as placeholder
- Console.log added for future integration point

### Future Integration
When implementing AI generation:
1. Create new modal component for AI options
2. Add state for AI generation process
3. Connect to LangGraph backend
4. Remove disabled state from button
5. Update tooltip to describe functionality

## Cleanup Tasks
- [ ] No test files or temporary code to remove
- [ ] Console.log for AI button is intentional (document this)
- [ ] All changes are production-ready
