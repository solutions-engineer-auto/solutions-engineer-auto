## Technical Risks

### 1. Position Tracking Complexity

**Risk Description**
- TipTap/ProseMirror positions are volatile and change with every edit
- Character offsets become invalid after any modification
- Concurrent edits can cause position conflicts

**Impact**
- Changes applied to wrong locations
- Data corruption
- Poor user experience

**Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Stable Anchor System**
   ```typescript
   interface StableAnchor {
     paragraphId: string;      // UUID for each paragraph
     offsetInParagraph: number; // Relative position
     absoluteFallback: number;  // Last known absolute position
   }
   ```

2. **Position Mapping Pipeline**
   - Track all document transactions
   - Map positions through change history
   - Use operational transformation (OT) principles

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Content-based matching as backup
   - Fuzzy position recovery
   - User confirmation for ambiguous cases

**Monitoring**
- Track position mapping failures
- Alert on >1% failure rate
- Log recovery method usage

### 2. AI Response Quality & Hallucination

**Risk Description**
- AI might change more than instructed
- Generated content may be factually incorrect
- Style/tone inconsistencies

**Impact**
- Loss of user trust
- Document errors
- Brand inconsistency

**Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Strict Prompt Engineering**
   ```python
   SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
   You are a precise document editor. Rules:
   1. ONLY edit the provided text
   2. NEVER add information not implied by the original
   3. Maintain the original style and tone
   4. Explain every change you make
   """
   ```

2. **Multi-layer Validation**
   - Token-level diff analysis
   - Semantic similarity scoring
   - Fact-checking integration
   - Style consistency checker

3. **Confidence Scoring**
   ```typescript
   interface AIResponse {
     suggestion: string;
     confidence: number; // 0-1
     reasoning: string;
     alternatives?: string[];
   }
   ```

4. **Human-in-the-loop Safeguards**
   - Require review for low-confidence changes
   - Flag suspicious modifications
   - Provide undo/rollback options

### 3. Performance & Scalability

**Risk Description**
- Large documents with hundreds of changes slow down
- Real-time sync creates network bottleneck
- Memory usage spikes with diff calculation

**Impact**

**Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Efficient Data Structures**
   ```typescript
   // Use immutable data structures
   import { List, Map } from 'immutable';
   
   // Implement rope data structure for large texts
   class RopeStructure {
     // Efficient for large document operations
   }
   ```

2. **Progressive Loading**
   - Virtualize change list
   - Lazy load change details
   - Paginate large change sets

3. **Optimized Diff Algorithm**
   - Use Myers' diff algorithm
   - Cache computed diffs
   - Incremental diff updates

4. **Performance Budgets**
   - Max 100ms for diff calculation
   - Max 50ms for UI updates
   - Max 2MB memory per document

### 4. Concurrent Editing Conflicts

**Risk Description**
- Multiple users editing simultaneously
- AI suggestions conflicting with user edits
- Race conditions in change application

**Impact**
- Lost work
- Confusing UI state
- Data inconsistency

**Mitigation Strategies**
1. **CRDT Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // Use Yjs for conflict-free replicated data types
   import * as Y from 'yjs';
   
   const ydoc = new Y.Doc();
   const ytext = ydoc.getText('content');
   ```

2. **Optimistic Locking**
   - Version tracking per change

   - Open beta (4 weeks)
   - General availability

2. **Feature Flags**
   ```typescript
   if (featureFlag('ai-diff-enhanced')) {
     // New implementation
   } else {
     // Stable fallback
   }
   ```

3. **Rollback Procedures**
   - Database migration rollback scripts
   - UI feature toggles
   - API version management

## Conclusion

Success requires:
1. **Technical Excellence**: Robust position tracking and performance
2. **User-Centric Design**: Simple, trustworthy interface
3. **Operational Resilience**: Multiple fallbacks and monitoring
