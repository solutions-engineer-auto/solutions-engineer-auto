# Add AI Integration to Existing Diff System

## 🎯 Summary
This PR adds AI integration to the already-working diff system. The diff visualization (highlights, overlays, accept/reject) is complete and functional. This PR simply replaces the hardcoded "TEST" suggestions with actual AI-generated edits.

## ✨ What's Being Added
- **Mock AI Service**: Returns realistic edit suggestions for testing
- **Edit Processor**: Handles multiple edits and finds text positions
- **AI Button Integration**: Updates existing Test Diff button to use AI
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of AI failures

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Created `mockAIService.js` to simulate AI responses
- Added `editProcessor.js` for parsing AI responses
- Updated button handler to call AI service instead of using "TEST"
- No changes to existing diff system (DiffExtensionV2, DiffMark, DiffOverlay)

## 📁 Files Changed
### New Files:
- `src/services/mockAIService.js` - Mock AI response generator
- `src/utils/editProcessor.js` - AI response parser

### Modified Files:
- `src/pages/DocumentEditorPage.jsx` - Updated Test Diff button (line 762)

### NO Changes to:
- ❌ `src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffExtensionV2.js` - Already works!
- ❌ `src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffMark.js` - Already works!
- ❌ `src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffOverlay.jsx` - Already works!
- ❌ `src/services/ChangeManagerV2.js` - Already works!

## 🧪 Testing
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open any document in the editor
3. Select some text
4. Click the "🧪 Test Diff" button
5. Should see AI-generated suggestion (not "TEST")
6. Accept/reject still works perfectly

### Before This PR:
- Clicking Test Diff shows "TEST" as replacement

### After This PR:
- Clicking Test Diff shows AI-generated suggestions

## ✅ Checklist
- [ ] Uses existing `editor.commands.addChange()` API
- [ ] No modifications to diff visualization system
- [ ] Mock service returns proper format
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Loading states added

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Replace mock service with real AI API integration
- Add user input for AI instructions
- Handle multiple simultaneous edits

## 💬 Notes for Reviewers
- The diff system is already 100% functional
- This PR only adds AI data to feed into it
- Total implementation is <100 lines of code
- Can be tested immediately with existing UI

## 🔗 Context
- Diff system already implemented and working
- This completes the AI integration portion only
