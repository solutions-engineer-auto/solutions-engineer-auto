# Add AI-Powered Diff System to Document Editor

## 🎯 Summary
This PR implements a visual diff system that allows users to see, review, and accept/reject AI-suggested changes to documents. The implementation uses TipTap marks for reliable position tracking as text changes.

## ✨ Features Added
- **Visual Diff Highlighting**: Changes are highlighted with colors:
  - 🟢 Green: Additions
  - 🔴 Red: Deletions  
  - 🔵 Cyan: Modifications
- **Interactive Overlays**: Click on any highlighted change to see Accept/Reject buttons
- **Debug Testing**: Added 🧪 Test Diff button in toolbar for easy testing
- **Position Tracking**: Implemented robust position tracking that maintains accuracy even as document changes
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Cmd/Ctrl + K for triggering AI edits (UI ready for backend integration)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Used TipTap marks instead of decorations for automatic position tracking
- Implemented `DiffExtensionV2` with proper ProseMirror integration
- Created `ChangeManagerV2` service for managing diff state
- Added overlay system using React portals for better z-index management
- Includes comprehensive test scripts in `public/` directory

## 📁 Files Changed
### Core Implementation:
- `src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffExtensionV2.js` - Main extension logic
- `src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffMark.js` - Mark definition for highlights
- `src/extensions/DiffExtension/DiffOverlay.jsx` - Accept/reject UI overlay
- `src/services/ChangeManagerV2.js` - State management for changes
- `src/pages/DocumentEditorPage.jsx` - Integration with editor + debug button

### Supporting Files:
- `src/utils/featureFlags.js` - Feature flag system
- Multiple test scripts in `public/` for validation
- Documentation files explaining the implementation

## 🧪 Testing
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open any document in the editor
3. Select some text
4. Click the "🧪 Test Diff" button in the toolbar
5. Click on the highlighted text to see accept/reject options

### Test Scripts Available:
- `public/test-position-tracking-fix.js` - Tests position tracking accuracy
- Run in browser console: `await import('/test-position-tracking-fix.js')`

## 🚀 Next Steps
This PR completes Phase 2 of the AI diff system. Future phases will include:
- Phase 3: Integration with AI backend for actual suggestions
- Phase 4: Polish features (batch operations, keyboard navigation, etc.)

## 💬 Notes for Reviewers
- This is my first major PR on this project, feedback welcome!
- The implementation prioritizes position tracking reliability over all else
- The debug button is temporary and can be removed once backend integration is complete
- Some test files in `public/` are for development only and can be cleaned up
