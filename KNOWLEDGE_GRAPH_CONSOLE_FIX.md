# Knowledge Graph Console Issues - Fixed

## What Was Happening

1. **Infinite Loop of RAG Generation**: The Knowledge Graph was stuck in a loop:
   - Tried to find vector relationships → Found 0 → Set `useRAG(false)`
   - This triggered a re-render → Which reset and tried again
   - Result: Repeated console messages about "Generating RAG relationships..."

2. **No Document Embeddings**: The vector service found 0 documents with embeddings because:
   - The `document_embeddings` table exists but has no data yet
   - Documents need to be processed to generate embeddings
   - This is expected for a new installation

3. **testFrontendFix Error**: Function not found because it was in a deleted test file

## Fixes Applied

1. **Stopped Automatic State Changes**: 
   - Removed automatic `setUseRAG(false)` when no relationships found
   - Now the toggle is purely user-controlled
   - Prevents the infinite re-render loop

2. **Created Test Script**: 
   - Added `public/test-vector-db.js`
   - Load it with: `<script src="/test-vector-db.js"></script>`
   - Run in console: `await testVectorDB()`
   - Shows embedding status and why relationships aren't appearing

## Current State

- Knowledge Graph loads without console spam
- Shows mock data when no embeddings exist
- User can toggle between Mock/RAG mode manually
- No more infinite loops or repeated messages

## Next Steps

To see real relationships in the Knowledge Graph:
1. Documents need to have embeddings generated
2. Use the existing edge function that auto-generates embeddings
3. Or manually process documents to create embeddings
4. Once embeddings exist, RAG mode will show real relationships

For now, use Mock Data mode to see how the graph works with simulated relationships.
